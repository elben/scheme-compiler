# Incremental Scheme Compiler

Scheme compiler based on Abdulaziz Ghuloum's papers (see references below).

The binary produced by the compiler runs only on Linux. Tested on Ubuntu.

Under developmentâ€”REPL not yet available.

### Overview

`compiler.scm` is a Scheme program that compiles our Incremental Scheme into x86.
This compiled form must be assembled together with `runtime.c`, which helps us
translate x86 values back into Scheme values.

To make it easier to follow along, git logs contain the text `[ch.section]` to
represent the chapter and section from the tutorial (below). For example,
a git log with `[1.2]` implies this commit solved a problem presented in Chapter
1.2. The paper, however, follows different chapter/section numbering. Paper
sections are denoted by double brackets, like `[[3.2]]`.

# Development

Download [Petite Chez Scheme](http://www.scheme.com/download/index.html#sec:petitechezscheme) (e.g. 64-bit threaded).

```
tar xvf pcsv8.4-ta6le.tar.gz
cd csv8.4/custom
./configure
make && sudo make install
```

Running tests:

```
cd ~/code/incrementing-scheme-compiler
petite compiler.scm
```

```
(test-all)
```

# Addendum and Notes

Changes and notes from Abdulaziz Ghuloum's papers.

Papers refer to `emit-program`, but the tests require you to name your compiling
function `compile-program`.
